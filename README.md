### Design
* Colour Scheme
    * The parent website (https://www.skyeonlineenglish.com/) uses a limited number of colours with the main background colour being grey.  It was chosen to give it a more professional / corporate feel.  The quiz is designed to be more enjoyable but remaining within the confines of the parent site's colour scheme.  Therefore three principle colours were chosen:
        * Background: #b877a9 - rgb(184,119,169) - Purple - used in Skye Online English's logo
        * Key Text: #0cad95 - rgb(12,173,149) - Green - used in Skye Online English's logo
        * Text Backgrounds: White

* Typography
    * The 'Lato' and 'Source Sans Pro' fonts (from Google Fonts) were used as a tthe main fonts throughout as they are both clean and easy to read.
    * Key langauge (including the quiz title) was written in #b8877a9 so that it stands out against the white background and black text

* Imagery
    * As the nature of the quiz is lannguage based there is very little imagery used.  Images were reserved for the 'Final Score' section as a means of adding enjoyment to the quiz.
