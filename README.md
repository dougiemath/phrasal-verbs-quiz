## Project Overview
---
Skye Online English (https://www.skyeonlineenglish.com/) is an online English-langauge teaching website which is owned by the developer of this project.

## User Experience (UX)
--- 
### User Stories
* First Time Visitor
    * I want to easily understand what the page is about.
    * I want to be able to navigate through the quiz as easily as possible
* Returning Visitor
    * I want to be able to redo the quiz to check my understanding after I check the answers easily
* Frequent Visitor
    * This is not going to be visited frequently, however the template may be duplicated for frequent users to be comfortable doing other quizes using the same format.

### Design
* Colour Scheme
    * The parent website (https://www.skyeonlineenglish.com/) uses a limited number of colours with the main background colour being grey.  It was chosen to give it a more professional / corporate feel.  The quiz is designed to be more enjoyable but remaining within the confines of the parent site's colour scheme.  Therefore three principle colours were chosen:
        * Background: #b877a9 - rgb(184,119,169) - Purple - used in Skye Online English's logo
        * Key Text: #0cad95 - rgb(12,173,149) - Green - used in Skye Online English's logo
        * Text Backgrounds: White

* Typography
    * The 'Lato' and 'Source Sans Pro' fonts (from Google Fonts) were used as a tthe main fonts throughout as they are both clean and easy to read.
    * Key langauge (including the quiz title) was written in #b8877a9 so that it stands out against the white background and black text

* Imagery
    * As the nature of the quiz is lannguage based there is very little imagery used.  Images were reserved for the 'Final Score' section as a means of adding enjoyment to the quiz.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
* First Time Visitor
    * The clean design and lack of navigation options allows the user to be led through the quiz.  There is nothing in the UI that could be construed as threatening.  There is no opportunity to deviate from the intended route through the quiz. First time users should have no problems with this quiz.
* Returning Visitor
    * Returning visitors may skip the 'language description' screen by simply scrolling to the bottom and clicking the 'Start Quiz' button.  In future, perhaps an additional button could be displayed for returning users to bypass this screen, but forcing the user to at least skim through the notes is more beneficial for their quiz preparation.
